# Liberator
The suite of test tools provided by Totally Ratted Developments &amp; their allies

Welcome to RatDriver, which is an additional abstraction layer that sits on top of Selenium and handles the underlying WebDriver code in a way that simplifies the coding required for testers to automate their tests. RatDriver places the focus back on knowing what the WebDriver should be doing during automated tests by removing the need to be an expert at Selenium. The standard pitfalls of automated testing, such as slow page loads and race conditions, are covered by the internal workings of RatDriver.

Currently available in both C# and Java versions, RatDriver is multi-platform and has been tested on Windows, MacOs and several flavours of Linux.

**NB: Visual Studio Users:**
Please note that RatDriver works with the versions of the drivers supplied and should only require changes if your browsers are not the up to date versions. You will need to mark these files as "Copy If Newer" so that they are copied to the build folder being used.
